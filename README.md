# Course site â€” Introduction to the Theory of Deep Learning

This is a tiny, dependencyâ€‘free website you can deploy with GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Copy `index.html` and `styles.css` into a GitHub repository (or download this folder and upload it).
2. (Optional) Put your proposal PDF at `assets/Proposal_for_Introduction_to_Theory_of_Deep_Learning.pdf` and the link on the page will work.
3. Turn on GitHub Pages: **Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Build and deployment â†’ Source: Deploy from a branch**. Choose your branch (e.g., `main`) and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Visit your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` and link it from your GitHub profile README.

## Editing

Open `index.html` and look for the **ðŸ”§ EDIT HERE** comments. Change text in place. The CSS is minimal and lives in `styles.css`.

- Meeting time is preset to **Thursdays, 2:00â€“3:30 PM** (edit under the *Logistics* section).
- Keep everything in this simple twoâ€‘file setup, or split into more files as you prefer.

## Tips

- If you prefer Markdown and Jekyll, you can rename `index.html` to `index.md` and add a minimal front matter block at the top (theme: minima), but this HTML version avoids build dependencies.
- The site is accessible and printâ€‘friendly by default.
